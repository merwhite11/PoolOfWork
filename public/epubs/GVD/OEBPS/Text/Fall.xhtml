        Draining, so that they stiffen into a rigid, brittle scaffolding, draining so that the grape skins soften and
        blacken, draining so that the grape juice sweetens. This season of palpable ripeness. Grapes hanging heavy on
        the branch. It starts slow, the champagne grapes, the sauvignon blanc, the chardonnay, the trucks driving up and
        down the valley loaded with bins of grapes. Then it</span><span class="c1 c3">’</span><span class="c1 c3">s the

        total) that we have just filled and the new tractor driven by Gutierrez is chugging down the middle of the next
        set of 8 rows, towing 2 empty macrobins for us to fill. Luis is counting the rows so we know which
        pair</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s turn it is to be closest to the tractor and which
        pair has to be on the outside, farthest from the tractor. Each position has its pros and cons, which is why we

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Under the glare of the headlamps, the grapes look like a greyish,
        globular alien fungus that we, a crew of highly-trained alien fungi exterminators, have been sent to remove as
        quickly as humanly possible. At first, I don</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t think of
        them as edible, or something that will eventually be squished into expensive wine. I just think of them as these
        Pacman pellets that I must make disappear in order to move forward. <br /><br />Then after the hype of nightfall
        has settled, and the stars are out and it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s some ambiguous
        dark hour, I start getting hungry, which is when the grapes become not alien fungi, but instead convenient

      cutting back the excess, thinning the crop so that what remained were two fat clusters, dangling like two wads of

        the trellis wire like a needle in a sewing machine, snipping off four clusters in one go, collecting them all in
        a hand, and dropping them into the bandeja, pushing the bandeja full of grapes through the dirt with the instep
        of their foot, guiding it over rocks and weeds as if it were a soccer ball, stamping their full bin down with
        their foot like a trash compactor, grabbing my bin out from under me, flipping it swiftly over the top of their
        own, hoisting the double-loaded crate over their head in one fluid motion, raising it over the trellis wire to
        dump it into the tractor, just now advancing forward, its lights pulling ahead, heaving its heavening load.

        We</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">ve shared food and water and gum. I have listened to
        the music off their phones for hours on end. I have seen how they shovel, how they squat, how they warm up their
        bodies in the morning. I have seen their entire repertoire of work clothes. I know who it is by looking under a
        row and seeing a pair of boots. I know their laughs, their coughs, their sneezes and the sound they make when
        lifting heavy things. I have seen them trip and fall. I have seen their faces when gulping down water in moments
        of extreme thirst and their faces of satisfaction after a good lunch. </span></p>

        increments, and ended up at $19 an hour. I got health insurance, overtime pay, and 3 sick days. Harvest rates
        are higher because the hours are sporadic and the work is harder. I made between $25 and $35 an hour for
        harvest; tractor drivers make more. <br /><br />There are also the people that pick </span><span

        dropped my coworker off at the trailer park in Napa where he lived, presumably amongst lots of other Mexicans.
        There was a little decorative flower bed at the entrance of the park and someone had gone and planted cornstalks
        in it. </span></p>

    <p class="p10 c4" style="">In their world, agriculture is as much a part of life as cooking. Sure they had grocery

      would want the workers of the world to unite, from my experience in the vines, I could see how that would be a
      complete disaster (see above rotten heap of grapes). </p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">But sometimes I wonder if we are really better off, with our hierarchies
        and our whizzing machines that allow us to do more work in less time. It</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span
        class="c1 c4">s not like we have more time as a result, we just do more. So the ratio is always the same. I call
        it the Wallace and Grommet effect. Like building this crazy contraption, to do something faster. But now you
        have to factor in the amount of time it takes to build and maintain the crazy contraption. Es la mezma, la
        mezma, mezma. </span></p>

        he had a kid and needed to make money. Now he</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s studying
        English at night. He grew up working in coffee bean fields. His hands are quick and precise, a lefty. His
        eyesight is exquisite and he never wears sunglasses. His work clothes are always clean, including his hats which
        are frayed at the brim from going through the wash. </span></p>

    <p class="p1" style=""><br /><span class="c1 c4">When I came to terms with my shortcomings in the field, I began to
        realize how doomed California</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s (and dare I say, the
        country</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s) state of agriculture would be if not for

        class="c1 c4">jobs for a job in the fields, even if we were able to muster up the critical mass, we</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">d still be doomed. Though not all my coworkers (see dentist,
        mechanical engineer, seamstress) worked in agriculture, the majority of them were planting corn or picking
        tomatoes, even if on a small scale, from a young age. A household chore for me was </span><span
        class="c1 c4">‘</span><span class="c1 c4">load the dishwasher</span><span class="c1 c4">’ </span><span
        class="c1 c4">whereas a household chore for my Mexican counterpart was </span><span class="c1 c4">‘</span><span
        class="c1 c4">go help your grandpa sow the corn field</span><span class="c1 c4">…</span><span class="c1 c4">and

        motorcycle. You will never catch up</span><span class="c1 c4">. There were many times when I felt ashamed of my
        upbringing. Like every advantage I had had growing up was working to my disadvantage. Like I had been raised
        without knowing what hard work was. And honestly, though I would consider myself a hard worker, I was raised in
        an environment where hard work was a contrivance. Sure, swim practice was hard, but that was by design. It was
        also only an hour and a half out of my day and dinner was waiting at home. </span></p>

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">And even if there was an equally skilled group of U.S. citizens,

        yourself, you do not understand sacrifice and I</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">d feel
        like a shell. No matter how hard I tried, somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew I had a safety net and it
        didn</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t really matter if I wasn</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t a fast fieldworker. I thought of the line from </span><span

        I don</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t get why we</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span

        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t get why the government continues to spend money on border control,
        when they need look no further than to the 75% of California</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span
        class="c1 c4">s agricultural labor force to see that it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s
        a complete waste. The country</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s simultaneous dependency on
        and denial of undocumented workers reminds me of a functioning alcoholic; it</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s toxic, but it works. Mexicans have good enough fakes to get a job,
        to get taxes taken out of their paychecks, but not good enough fakes to leave the country and get back in again.
        When Trump was still president, I asked Aaron what he thought about his threats to build a wall. He laughed and
        said, </span><span class="c1 c8">then we</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">ll just ride in

        class="c1 c4">t get why, once you have immigrated illegally, there is no path to citizenship beyond getting
        married, a stroke of sheer circumstance that has nothing to do with the 30, or even 10 years of labor someone
        has put in on American soil. </span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p10 c4" style="">Mexican immigrants want to be citizens, not so they can stay, but so they can go home,
      and come back when they want to work. As it is now, without papers, going home is like ripping up the golden
      ticket it took for them to get here in the first place. The risk of not being able to get another golden ticket is
      far too high, and the alternatives far too expensive. </p>
