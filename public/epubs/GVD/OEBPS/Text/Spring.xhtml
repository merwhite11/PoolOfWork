    <span class="c1 c3">A time of great upheaval. Out of the dark knobby wood, up they come, out
      they sprout. Pushing through the air, shoving out little beginnings, fuzzy and white like cotton, and up they
      climb, shoving ever upward. Buds, folded in on themselves, then unfolding, pink and green, like mini heads of
      cabbage, fanning out, one layer at a time. Time to cut, mow. There is the sound of machinery grinding all
      around</span><span class="c1 c3">—</span><span class="c1 c3">mower, gramegna, weedwacker, woodchipper.
      Mobilization of people, movement. Up. Up. Breezy and sunny with shapely clouds. The sun filtering through the
      now fully flushed leaves, soft and juicy with life, absorbent and thick. </span>

      class="c1 c4">–</span><span class="c1 c4"> like a head in a bonnet. Picking them, eating them, tastes same as a
      pea. Sprinkling lightly, everything felt far away, distant like behind a screen. Painting pruning cuts with Don

  <p class="p10 c4" style="">Now suckering for first time today. Kneeling to pray at the base of the vine. I am a
    lonely gal in the vines, an outsider on many levels. But I am a lonely gal outside the vines too. Tunneling.</p>

  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">All of the sudden the plants explode. We go from stalling to wait for
      them to running to keep up. Out of every node, on every arm </span><span class="c1 c4">– </span><span

      (quatas</span><span class="c1 c8">)</span><span class="c1 c4">. <br /><br />The job is to remove all the extra
      shoots: the shoots that burst out of the crinkly bark on the head of the trunk, the shoots that grow in
      inopportune positions out of the arms, one of the two quatas (</span><span class="c1 c8">DESQUATA LAS QUATAS!
    </span><span class="c1 c4">The foreman will yell periodically throughout the day), and the shoots that grow out of
      the base of the trunk (</span><span class="c1 c8">LA PATITA LA PATITA!</span><span class="c1 c4"> The foreman
      calls out to remind you).<br /><br />Some blocks must be suckered very precisely and we leave only 5-6 shoots if
      the vine looks weak, and 7-8 shoots if the vine looks strong. On days of precision suckering like this, the
      foreman calls out: </span><span class="c1 c8">CINCO SEIS CINCO SEIS</span><span class="c1 c4">, all day long,
      because sure enough you</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">ll forget and start leaving 7 or
      8. </span></p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Pulling off suckers is very satisfying. You don</span><span
      class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t need any tools except your gloved hands and sometimes your scissors.
      It</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s easy at first. The suckers are young, translucent
      jelly tubes, you can knock them off accidentally if you</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">re
      not careful. They snap off with a delightful little click. All day it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span
      class="c1 c4">s clickity, click, click, click. Like the sound of floss snapping between teeth. Click click.
      It</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s a good thing it</span><span
      class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s satisfying, because there</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span
      class="c1 c4">s loads of them, fistfuls after fistfuls. And then, in a month, more. By then, they are tough and
      lignified, yellowed with age. You have to really yank to tear them from the bark. </span></p>

  <p class="p10 c4" style="">Tamales de Lidia y su papa. Gulped down champurrado. Need to be more healthy/moderate on
    Saturdays. Feel a bit like an animal. Worked with Alejandro. Laughed really hard cuz Ivan made me. Went to pool,
    napped. Feel weird and out of sorts, behind on my hobbies. Probably just very sleep deprived due to 3 am wakings.
    Really fascinated by Cardi B. </p>

  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">The trellis wire strung up, loose and sagging in some parts from all the
      yanking of pruning. Low afternoon light glinting off, so it glows like strands of a spider web strung up between
      the posts. Ivan kept trying to get me to say </span><span class="c1 c8">lagartijas</span><span class="c1 c4">
      which means lizards, and also push-ups, but I couldn</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t get

  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">If I was to sum up the Mexican language in one word, it would be ya. You
      can say it at pretty much any point of pretty much any sentence, and it will make sense. It is maybe a bit like

      class="c1 c4">‘</span><span class="c1 c4">like</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">, but to my
      ears, it adds spark and relevancy to your meaning, rather than dulling it. It is a word that conflates the past
      into the present, so that when someone asks you </span><span class="c1 c8">Ya son altos?</span><span
      class="c1 c4"> it can mean </span><span class="c1 c8">They</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span

      is exactly the sound I was trying not to make, but was making in my head because the shovel was heavy. It made
      me laugh so hard I couldn</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t stop and every time I went to
      lift another shovel full of dirt, I thought of that sound and burst out laughing again. Dante and Ivan just
      stood there, leaning against their shovels, watching me try to shovel and laugh at the same time and Dante said,
    </span><span class="c1 c8">Comiste el payaso plebilla?</span><span class="c1 c4"> which means, did you eat the
      clown litte plebe? (Dante calls everyone a plebe) and by then I was crying from laughing. </span></p>

  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">Everyone bemoans the tortillas here. The food in general, but mostly the tortillas. In
    Mexico the tortillas are hand-made fresh, from dough that is freshly made, from flour that is freshly milled, from
    corn that is freshly harvested. </p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">But they make do with the factory print-out tortillas of the North. At every lunch, out
    comes a bag full of them, out comes the charred skillet atop a canister of gas lit stove. Fling a few tortillas on
    top and in less than a minute there is a stack of warm toasted tortillas piling up and steam is rising up out of
    the thermoses of whatever people cooked up that morning (tomatoey potatoes, saucy beans, pasta, potatoey tomatoes,
    nopales (cactus leaves), lentils, diced hot dogs, unidentifiable fatty bits of beef and pork, tomatoey eggs) and
    into the tortilla it goes (unless it is shrimp or tuna salad, which per Mexican law, have to be eaten on
    tostadas). </p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">The most common size of tortilla is by American standards, the mini soft
      taco size. It is a good way of making a little bit of food go a long way because you really can</span><span
      class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t put too much filling in the tortilla or it will squish out all over
      your pants. Just put a little in, bring the ends together and then fold them over to one side and bite into it
      with your arms extended in front of you. When I eat with the young guys, we eat standing up, using the truck bed
      as a table. When I eat with the old guys we sit on upside down buckets. Except Gutierrez. He sits on the bucket
      right side up because according to him, it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s more

  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">I am only hands on wood, the part where the tough bark of the branch
      gives way to the smooth fibrous stem. I am feeling, grabbing, ripping, pulling, deciding, quickly now, count to
      6, 6 shoots per branch, but don</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t lose yourself in
      counting, snip out doubles, clear out middle, scrub bark clean with hand like sponge, get shoots at bottom of
      trunk, stomp them off with foot if possible, save time, save bending over, now go, move, adelante, keep them in
      ear shot and if not that, then in eye shot, then they get away. I look up and they are gone.</span></p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">There is a related rates math problem in here. If Luis Antonio suckers vines at a rate of
    3 vines per minute and Meredy suckers vines at a rate of 1.5 per minute, how long will it take for Meredy to fall
    10 vines behind, 20 vines, 30? The longer the row, the greater the number of vines I will fall behind. I think
    there is something instinctually unsettling about being the slowest in the pack. I think somewhere deep in my
    body, I remember that the slowest gets eaten and there is a frantic desperation that washes over me as I realize I
    am falling farther and farther behind with every vine I move forward. </p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">I try to speed up but there is no way. Like someone telling you to be
      happy when you feel you are as happy as you can possibly be, when you weren</span><span

      doesn</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t help, moving my hands faster doesn</span><span
      class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t help. There is a frustrating lack of correlation between athleticism
      and fieldwork. I have one speed. </span></p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">There is a sinking sense of loss when this acceptance settles in and I
      bear down and carry on, perhaps even slower because now I have nothing to even strive for. Eventually Ismael,
      Luis or Gerardo, the fast guys who are already done with their row, come into my row to help me out and I feel
      very embarrassed, but still I manage to say, </span><span class="c1 c4">“</span><span class="c1 c4">Thank
      you,</span><span class="c1 c4">”</span><span class="c1 c4"> because for some reason </span><span
      class="c1 c4">“</span><span class="c1 c4">Gracias</span><span class="c1 c4">”</span><span class="c1 c4"> sounds
      a little corny. On bad days, there is a certain feeling of dread upon entering each row because I know just how
      it will go. I will stay afloat for the first 20 or so vines. Then I will begin to drown. Then I will begin to
      sink. This is why I don</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t like long rows. </span></p>

  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Sulfur is the magic fairy dust of vineyards. It has been used for years
      and because it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s an element straight off the periodic
      table and not a chemical, it classifies as organic, so you can bet your bottom dollar that the grapes that went
      into that organic wine were sprayed up the wazoo with sulfur. Organic and elemental as it may be, it</span><span
      class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s still a force to be reckoned with. Sprayers suit up in white haz
      suits and haz masks to spray at night (when there is less chance of wind) and the vineyard is off limits for the

  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>

  <p class="p9 c3" style="">Vocabulario</p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Vocabulary</span><span class="c1 c3"> </span></p>
  <p class="p1 p2" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">When I mentioned to some fellow anglophones that I</span><span
      class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">d been learning Spanish on the job, some said, well I imagine
      it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s a pretty limited vocabulary. I disagreed. </span></p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">What I realized about Spanish is that they use Strong Verbs. A Strong Verb is the action
    itself, which Spanish speakers use in normal conversation. A Weak Verb is what English speakers use, which
    consists of some blah catch-all verb paired with a tacky preposition, which is probably what makes English at once
    so easy to learn and yet so difficult to master. </p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">Some examples that illustrate the difference between Strong Verbs and Weak Verbs: </p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">English: I get up at 4.</p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">Spanish: Me levanto a las 4 (I raise myself at 4).</p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">English: I could get into that. </p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Spanish: Yo me animar</span><span class="c1 c4">í</span><span
      class="c1 c4">a (I would animate myself).</span></p>

  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">English: I can</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t
      tell the difference. </span></p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Spanish: No puedo distinguir la diferenc</span><span
      class="c1 c4">í</span><span class="c1 c4">a (I can</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t
      distinguish the difference). </span></p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">English: Got it. </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">Spanish: Te comprendo (I comprehend you). </p>
  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">English: You get used to it. </p>
  <p class="p10 c4" style="">Spanish: Te acostumbras (You accustom yourself).</p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c8">This is the answer I get to a lot of the questions I ask. How do you work
      for 15 hours a day? Te acostumbras. Doesn</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">t squatting so

      comer</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">, which means </span><span
      class="c1 c8">‘</span><span class="c1 c8">you can get used to anything, except not eating</span><span
      class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">. </span></p>

  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Of course, all this articulate verb usage comes embedded in a slew of
      slang, namely the repeat use of the word guey, which strictly translates to bull and cuckold, but loosely
      translates to dude. </span><span class="c1 c8">No mames guey</span><span class="c1 c4"> literally means,
    </span><span class="c1 c8">don</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">t suck dude</span><span
      class="c1 c4">, but is the figurative equivalent of, </span><span class="c1 c8">No f</span><span
      class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">in way man</span><span class="c1 c4">. <br /></span></p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Another other common slang term is saying </span><span class="c1 c8">a la
      verga</span><span class="c1 c4"> after anything, particularly, </span><span class="c1 c8">Vamos a la
      verga!</span><span class="c1 c4"> Literally: </span><span class="c1 c8">Let</span><span
      class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">s go to the dick!</span><span class="c1 c4"> Or figuratively:
    </span><span class="c1 c8">Let</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">s get the hell out of here!

  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>

  <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
  <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">But then again, this verb studded slang comes neatly wrapped in a very
      well-mannered greeting, as Mexicans address each other (particularly those older than them) with Don (like
      calling someone Sir or Mister) or Do</span><span class="c1 c4">ñ</span><span class="c1 c4">a (M</span><span
      class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">am or Missus) followed by their first name, or a nickname, so you can
      at once be respectful and familiar. For example, one older guy is named Tranquilino and people call him Don
      Tranqui. There</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s also Don Chino for Arnulfo (because he
      has curly hair and chino means curly) and Don Chava for Salvador. </span></p>
