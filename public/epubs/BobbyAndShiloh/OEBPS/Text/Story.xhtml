        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Let’s pretend Bobbie and Shiloh save the night. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">I was not totally focused when leaving for shut up and write on
                Monday. I
                went on a hike with a neighbor and it was better than expected so I was in kind of a floaty, energetic
                place
                from all the laughter and conversation and cardio. I forgot my notebook so turned around and went back
                for it,
                but when back en route after retrieval, I did a mental check in my bag to see if I had remembered my
                u-bar lock,
                and yes, I had, in the front pocket, there from this morning when I went swimming. I reflected on how I
                usually
                bring 2 u-bar locks, but then how maybe that’s part of settling in—I’d been here 4 months now—trusting
                my spot
                more. I thought a bit about bike theft then focused on getting over 3 lanes of traffic to make an
                unprotected
                left into the bus lane, which is the most sketchy but also most exhilarating part of my ride to shut up
                and
                write. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">When I got there, I realized I’d also left my headphones which was a
                bummer because they often play loud Yemeni music at this café, which for the most part is less
                distracting than
                music in English because I can’t understand the lyrics, but sometimes more distracting because the music
                can get
                kind of hectic and chant-like and fall into unpredictable patterns that are not conducive to writing.
                The café
                barista guy will also turn it off completely, then turn it back on at high volume, then low volume, then
                switch
                in the middle of a song. Then today there was a talking in English segment, a podcast or an ad, but very
                low so
                I couldn’t tell what they were saying. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">After shut up and write, I went back to my bike and the first thing I
                saw
                were the two forks of the front tire sticking up in the air. I had the sinking oh no oh no feeling and
                walked
                closer to see the full damage – bike flipped over, front tire gone, back tire out of its socket but held
                in
                place by the 1 u-bar that I’d used to lock the back wheel to the frame (they’d tried). I was happy I’d
                brought
                my lights and helmet in with me, because I’d even considered leaving them with the bike that night,
                since I’d
                started leaving them at the place where I swim in the mornings (in a totally different and safer
                neighborhood at
                6 am). </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">I was so sad especially since I had just gotten my bike serviced and
                my
                handlebar gears switched out for thumb gears, which was a huge upgrade. I took a picture and drew a sad
                crying
                face on it and sent it to Logan, the neighbor who I’d hiked with and was still texting in the wake of
                the hike.
            </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p4" style=""><br /></p>
        <img src="../Images/sad-bike.jpg" alt="Picture 5" style="margin:auto;display:block;width:100%" />

        <p class="p1 p4" style=""><br /></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">In hindsight, I see I really missed an opportunity to use the bike
                rack
                as the sad mouth. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Then I got to work trying to get my bike tire back in the socket. I
                thought about how I’d have to take it to Valencia Cyclery the next day. And how I’d have to fix the flat
                tire on
                my other bike which I’d been putting off doing for a while. I thought about how, once I got the back
                tire back
                on, I’d lock it up to the rack again, get a lyft bike home. Then come back with my car to pick up my
                bike
                amputee. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">It was taking me a while to get the back wheel back in between the
                gears.
                For someone that once spent 3-months riding her bike cross-country and sometimes changing up to 4 flat
                tires a
                day, I’ve never really mastered the back tire insertion. I feel like every time I do it, it just somehow
                sinks
                into place after some fiddling but I’m never sure exactly what I do that makes it go in. I have never
                developed
                a protocol like, step 1 do this, step 2 this. I just start fumbling around with the chain and pulling
                that lever
                thing and getting my hands covered in grease. That’s the protocol. I stick to that one very closely
                every time.
            </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Eventually I got my tire in. Then I got my water bottle out of my
                backpack and tried to rinse some of the grease off my hands and wiped my wet, greasy hands on my
                backpack. I
                looked at my phone and read Logan’s message that said, “how are you going to get home?” <br /><br />Then
                these 2
                guys on bikes came riding down the little alley behind the SFMOMA where I was, one guy on either side of
                me. The
                guy on the left had a reusable shopping bag filled with perhaps his belongings hanging off the handlebar
                of his
                hybrid trek bike. The other guy had on a white helmet with a little brim, on top of a baseball cap, on
                top of a
                black gaiter that fit snuggly over his head. Gaiter guy was on an e-bike with the cushion-bench in the
                back for
                kids. Trek bike guy said, how you doing? to me as he biked by and I said, really sad. My front tire is
                gone.
                Then I said, somewhat in a joking accusatory voice, did you guys take my tire? You’re my number 1 and 2
                suspects.</span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Then they stopped. And they said, we didn’t take your tire, but we
                know
                the guy who did. That’s our buddy. We’ll get it back for you. It’s just down the street. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">I had not even considered that possibility. One that I could get the
                tire
                back, that it was still an object out there in the near-by world and two, that I could just have a
                normal
                conversation with these two people that seemed to be bike thieves, or at least were in cahoots with a
                few. I
                have even thought about how I hate bike thieves, because I love biking so much. Gaiter guy said, we’re
                poor,
                that’s why we steal bikes. But we don’t take them from people like you. I don’t know what made me
                different from
                every other person they steal bikes from. I’m a 30-year white female who works in tech. Whoopdeedo.
            </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""> <span class="c1"> They introduced themselves as Bobby and Shiloh. Shiloh was having a
                lot
                of tooth pain. He kept jumping around cuz his tooth hurt so bad. He said he’s getting it pulled
                tomorrow. He had
                beautiful golden, brown skin smoothed over a truly amazing bone structure. I wanted to tell him that he
                had good
                bones, so it’s too bad his teeth weren’t working out for him, but it was too complicated of a way to
                compliment
                and console him at the same time, so I just admired and sympathized as he took out this little tube with
                the
                tiny tip like that Neosporin comes in and squeezed it into his mouth. I don’t know what was in that tube
                but he
                started hopping around and looking all high in his eyes and then kicked his bike pedal with his shin,
                then had
                to walk off that pain saying, I always do that. Kick the pedal. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2"><span class="c1"> That's the worst when that happens, I said.</span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Meanwhile Bobby was asking me if I worked in tech and was surprised
                I’d
                never heard of an RFID reader. He said they cost 250 and you can basically steal anything with them. I
                could get
                your credit card number right now with one he said. He had a daughter who was 11 months, whose name is
                also
                Bobby. I said I loved that name for a girl. Bobby the dad had been in combat in Panama and was shot, so
                he said
                he got money from that, but not much. He asked what did I know about criminal AI? And, was it good to
                create
                your own AI bot? I said, I didn’t even know we had troops in Panama. He said, oh yeah, ever hear of
                Noriega? I
                said, no, but it rang a bell. But later I realized that it’s because there’s a street in the Outer
                Sunset called
                Noriega. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Shiloh said he was from Oakland. His parents were crackheads. They
                were
                in and out of penitentiary. He doubled over in agony from the pain in his tooth. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">I told Bobby I worked in tech, but had actually just gotten laid off
                on
                Monday so now I didn’t work anywhere. He asked, why’d you get laid off? And I said, because the company
                got
                acquired and they laid off thousands of people and I was one of them. Then he asked, can I ask what
                company that
                is? And I said VMware.</span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Then Shiloh who was still hopping around from the excruciation of his
                tooth and also from the effect of whatever was in the little tube, was all, Oh I know. They’re the ones
                that
                make the uh, the virtual, the virtual desktop.</span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Yup, I said in a way that did not reveal how utterly astonished I was
                that a bike thief living on the streets knew what a VMware virtual desktop was. I guess that’s San
                Francisco for
                you. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Shiloh and Bobby had known each other for 7 years. Shiloh went off to
                get
                the bike wheel. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">He came back without it and said he couldn’t find it, then Bobby said
                he
                (the thief) went to the other side of the building. T-Bone’s got it on 5</span><span
                class="c1 c4"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="c1"> he said.  </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Shiloh left again in pursuit of T-Bone.</span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Bobby asked me if I thought AI was dangerous. I said, I don’t know
                much,
                but if even the engineers who work at Open AI think we should pump the brakes, then it’s probably a sign
                we
                should pump the brakes. Shiloh came back with the tire. I was so happy I threw both my hands up in the
                air and
                said Yayyyyy!!! </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">I said what do I owe you? Can I get you guys some food? I only had 3
                dollars cash on me so I asked if he took venmo. But Shiloh wouldn’t take anything. He said, if I could
                make your
                night, that’s all that counts for me. Then he was lost in a fit of agony again and was down on his hands
                and
                knees moaning. He got a gallon carton of orange guava juice out of his bag and a 1-liter bottle of
                listerine and
                was chugging one and chasing with the other. He pulled out a bottle of pills and asked, how many
                milligrams is
                this? </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">I would’ve been surprised that a guy who seemed high out of his mind
                on
                fentanyl or something of the sort would care about the dosage of generic ibuprofen, but after the
                virtual
                desktop comment I knew not to doubt Shiloh. I read it and said 500mg. He said, ok that’s good and then
                took out
                2 and swallowed it with more juice and listerine. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Bobby said let’s go to mcdonald’s, so we biked there. I felt like my
                brake wasn’t working. Bobby said we’ll fix it when we get to mcdonald’s. He said, that fentanyl stuff is
                killing
                everyone. I said, yeah don’t go near it. He said, I don’t touch it. I said, yeah well I guess if you
                were shot
                at in combat you know life is precious. He said, it is. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">He had 2 stick and poke style tear drop tattoos and some other
                markings
                on his face. He had a nice face and something childish about his nose. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">He said, you know they’re making AI soldiers that can run a 3-minute
                mile
                and hop 30-foot walls? I said, I hadn’t heard about those but that’s terrifying. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">He said, a regular soldier is going to lose against one of those. He
                said, but at the end of the day they’re just programmed. You just have to trick them. The liars are
                going to
                come to the front and win the war, he said. You just have to trick them.</span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">We got to mcdonald’s and I realized I hadn’t closed the little latch
                that
                clamps the brake pads shut, so that’s why the brake wasn’t working. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">I said, I’ll buy you some food. He said, are you hungry? And I said
                no,
                are you? And he said yes, but if you’re not hungry then I don’t want you to buy me anything. You just
                got laid
                off, you got to save your money. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">When I was biking home, I thought about how I maybe should’ve
                pretended I
                was hungry and gotten food with him so he could eat something. But I didn’t feel like Bobby was the
                let’s
                pretend type. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Although, it already felt pretend. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p7" style=""><span class="c1">A pretend world where there’s no difference between me and you.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Pretend like I know what hunger, real hunger feels like. </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1"> </span></p>
        <p class="p1 p2" style=""><span class="c1">Pretend my sadness at losing my bike tire could even be in the same
                category of emotion as the one that made you stick and poke tear tattoos under your right eye. </span>
        </p>
