        feel close to you. The vineyard feels small; like if you took the time, you could feasibly count every vine and
        see that it is only a matter of multiplying 100 rows by 96 vines per row. You can see that it is not a massive,
        impossible sea. You can see that it is just a big thing made up of many small components. </span>

        the gate code for the vineyard where we</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">re working that
        day, I feel the cold and the wind and think how unhospitable it feels out there and roll up the window ASAP,

        the cars are parked and pull in between two. Turn off my lights. I sit in the dark and wait as the black drains
        out of the sky. Some people are drinking from thermoses illuminated by the blue-green glow of a Facebook feed. I

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">I sent my resume to a vineyard management company and got called in for
        an interview. The boss told me that there would be a big learning curve and I nodded my head. He also told me it
        would be very physically challenging and I nodded my head again. At the time, I felt I was no stranger to
        physical discomfort: I grew up dancing</span><span class="c1 c4"> –</span><span class="c1 c4"> staying up late
        to force my legs into the splits and my feet into pointe shoes, and swimming </span><span
        class="c1 c4">–</span><span class="c1 c4"> waking up early to hold my breath for uncomfortably long amounts of
        time. I had also spent the past five months working on a vineyard in Chile, and my body, though after harvest it
        had been sore in a way I didn</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t know was possible, had
        held up just fine. The boss asked if I spoke Spanish and I said, si (which was true, though I was far from
        fluent) and I got the job. </span></p>

        it was all white. White caps rounding out the hilltops. So cold grabbing the frosty canes, had to suck on my
        fingers to warm them up. I felt like I was the only cold one and I asked Dante if his feet were cold and he
        said, </span><span class="c1 c8">Helados</span><span class="c1 c4">, which made me feel better. He wears fashion

        branches sticking straight up from the trunk like antennae. It is the tiers</span><span class="c1 c4">’
      </span><span class="c1 c4">job to bend those branches around the trellis wire and then secure them with a twisty,
        the kind you might find wrapped around a bread bag. The idea is to get the branch in a good supported position
        in preparation for the fruitful burden it will soon bear. Too many twists around the wire, and the branch snaps;
        too few, and the branch unravels the second you let go.</span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Sometimes the branch snaps the moment I touch it, like it was waiting all

        there goes a branch-worth of would-be grapes. Sometimes an ugly, negative thought leaks like an ink stain out
        into my work and snap, snap snap, there go 3 more. At the sound of this snapping, somebody calls out,
      </span><span class="c1 c8">Palomitas!</span><span class="c1 c4"> which literally translates to </span><span

        with help from someone already working in the North), and taking the risk of crossing the border. They have many

        they</span><span class="c1 c4">—</span><span class="c1 c4">obscured by 3 or 4 rows of vines</span><span
        class="c1 c4">—</span><span class="c1 c4">can radio back to establish contact. Then throw your voice, and out it
        sails, towards your announced recipient, but for all to hear. Sometimes, because of a certain sloped topography,
        you can carry on conversations from unlikely distances. When the platica is good, you forget you are even
        working. When the platica is too good, you squat down to get a good look at your interlocutor, and at this point
        you are full on socializing and you really should not be getting paid for that. But there are so many things to
        discuss: music, family, rodeos, other people, who sings this song, describing directions without using any
        street names, women, narcos and who they killed, the prices of things, women again, doubts, what</span><span

    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Of course, the platica can go south and you can start feeling like
        you</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">re doing two jobs instead of just one. In this case,
        it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s best to just abort by saying, </span><span
