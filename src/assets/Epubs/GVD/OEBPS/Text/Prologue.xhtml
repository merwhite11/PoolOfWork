        class="c1 c4">6</span><span class="c1 c4">’’</span><span class="c1 c4">, white, athletically built American. I
        graduated high school, then college, then by a series of missed and taken opportunities (which I guess is how
        anything ever happens in life),</span><span class="c1 c8"> </span><span class="c1 c4">I wound up working field
        labor in vineyards. </span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p10 c4" style="">My first job as a fieldworker was in Sonoma. I was assigned to a crew of mostly
      millennials, just like me. Unlike me, they were all Mexican, male and spoke no English. </p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Then, after a Winter pruning olive trees, I went back to vineyards again,
        this time in the Napa Valley. I found myself on a crew of </span><span class="c1 c4">‘</span><span
        class="c1 c4">lifers</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">, older guys who had been in the U.S.
        longer than I</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">d been alive, and whose kids were just as
        American as me. </span></p>

    <p class="p9 c3" style="">El surco</p>

    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">This is the place in between the rows of vines. It is where someone will
        direct you to when they call out, </span><span class="c1 c8">Agarrate un surco!</span><span class="c1 c4">,
        which means grab a row. It is where you will emerge out of after a long day and stuff a branch or an empty water
        bottle into the steel tube of the end post, so as to bookmark where you left off. It is the negative space of
        the vineyard where the workers work, in the dirt and dust, or in the wet and waist-high grasses, depending on
        which side of the year we are on. It is the blank space between the lines where, while working, listening,
        talking to myself in my head, I began to write. </span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">It has been a bit harder than expected to translate those
        mentally-scribbled surco sentences into rows of text on the page. I</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span
        class="c1 c4">ve realized that this is partially because the voice in my head took on many different voices.
        Sometimes it was in English, and as time went on and my understanding of Spanish deepened, it often came out in
        Spanish. Sometimes it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s factual and journalistic, and
        looking back on it I think, ok well we were clearly suckering that day, but how did I feel about all that?
        Sometimes it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s poetic and impressionistic and I wonder
        what task we were even doing that day. The following four seasons are an amalgamation of my different
        experiences over the past five years in the vines. </span></p>
