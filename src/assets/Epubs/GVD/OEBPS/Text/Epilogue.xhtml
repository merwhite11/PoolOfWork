    <p class="p1" style=""><br /><span class="c1 c4">In Chile I lived in a house with a woman named Estela. One day she
        asked me if I thanked God for all he has given me. I said, </span><span class="c1 c8">I feel like everything I
        have, I</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">ve gotten through hard work</span><span
        class="c1 c4">. At this she turned from me and said, </span><span class="c1 c8">Miiraa, la gringa

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Joel is a model citizen, but the irony is that he</span><span

        proud, like he was finally contributing. I asked Joel what his childhood home was like and he pulled up a Google
        image of a quintessential 3</span><span class="c1 c10"><sup>rd</sup></span><span class="c1 c4"> world home
      </span><span class="c1 c4">– </span><span class="c1 c4">the kind with a corrugated metal roof and slats of wood on
        the sides. It sometimes feels unfeasible; synthesizing this backstory into the tissue of the person before me;
        this successful, shrewd businessman clicking through Exel spreadsheets and sympathizing with the owner of the
        winery, who was on speaker expressing his lack of time due to the fact that they were down-sizing their Carmel
        home. </span><span class="c1 c8">That other one</span><span class="c1 c4">…</span><span

        said. </span><span class="c1 c8">Your parents did not choose to be poor</span><span class="c1 c4">. I said
        people like him have to first find the ladder and then climb it from the bottom. People like me were born onto
        the upper-rungs. All we have to do is not fall off. Both are hard, but where you start is not a choice. </span>

        tractor revealing the angle at which the tractorista took a certain turn and muttering </span><span
        class="c1 c8">pinche chaparro</span><span class="c1 c4">. Now he</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span

        does a grape leaf taste like?</span><span class="c1 c4"> and plucking one off to chew it up and then spitting
        out the purple anthocyanin spittle it turns into. He</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s
        walking fast so you have to trot to catch up. He</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s at the

        class="c1 c8">He drank too much</span><span class="c1 c4">. He</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span

        think?</span><span class="c1 c4"> All the while calculating yield estimates based off how many clusters

    <p class="p10 c4" style="">I am a web of indecision though, doubts leading to questions, to more imagined futures
      when all I want to do is write and make dance videos. I know so clearly what I want but am so unsure about how I

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Lucino got an offer to work the late-shift in a plastic factory. He
        decided to take it because they pay bonuses every 3 months and he would end up making more than in the
        vineyards. He got a second job to fill the mornings in a tortilla factory. One night in the plastic factory, his
        hand lingered a moment too long and the automated knives that cut the sheets of plastic tore into his finger and
        cut two tendons. He got surgery in the ER and they did their best to stitch it back together but it looked
        horrific, black and bloated, like a dead person</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s finger
        had been glued onto his hand. They told him he may never be able to make a fist. His house in Michoacan is
        complete, including the repairs that were needed after a shower of bullets came down on the roof, courtesy of
        the mafia whose presence now looms much heavier over his childhood home, so that now people don</span><span

        with fear</span><span class="c1 c4">. Friends from his town have found their way to Sonoma and reported that he
        built a big ol</span><span class="c1 c4">’ </span><span class="c1 c4">house, but to him it</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s as if it doesn</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Telling Joel about studying. Our heads pressed against the sun-warmed
        window of the sliding glass door in the office. I said, </span><span class="c1 c8">I</span><span

        class="c1 c8">but see how easy it is for you to change</span><span class="c1 c4">. For the first time, I get
        what he means when he says that I</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">m </span><span
        class="c1 c8">preparada</span><span class="c1 c4">– </span><span class="c1 c4">that I have this vague and

        class="c1 c4">educated</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">. He said for me to not put my

        Unlike in vineyards, they do E-Verify which means if your primo hooked you up with your Permanent Resident card

        The contract laborers are always coming in to HR to ask for overtime. Meanwhile the legal hirees are flakes and
