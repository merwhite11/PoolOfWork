      Bright mornings. Longer days, longer hours. Late afternoons thick with the heat of the
      sliding sun. The canopy full, leafy long vines, tilting, slanting, bowing over. The grapes squishy and sticky to
      the touch, tart and sweet to the taste. The leaves dry, snap off easy now. The sun splitting down the middle of
      the sky. Full exposure, the radiant peak.

    <p class="p10 c4" style="">Full body fatigue.</p>
    <p class="p10 c4" style="">After day of much heat. Lots of things ache and sore, right ankle, left bicep. I want to

    <p class="p10 c4" style="">Shoot tucking</p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p10 c4" style="">Vines, when left to their own devices are nasty, snarling tendrilled things, that cling
      onto anything in their midst. Where there were once neat little rows of pink and green sprouts in Spring, there
      now is a chaotic jungle of vines spilling out over the corset of their trellis. </p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Here, the humble shoot-tucker places themself, beneath the arched canopy
        of the bowing vines, not unlike a surfer in the curl of an endlessly cresting green wave. The nice thing is that
        it is shady beneath the canopy. The not nice thing is that you</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span
        class="c1 c4">re looking up all day so your neck starts to hurt and your hat is useless. </span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">The job is to tuck each vine into the wire. Some vineyard tasks, when
        taken out of the context of labor, sound ridiculous. Look at this massive sea of tangled, slanted, falling,
        twisted vines, he can</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t possibly mean </span><span
        class="c1 c8">every </span><span class="c1 c4">vine? But then consider we have a crew of 6-8 people and 10 hours
        to do it. We have water and food and a 30-minute lunch break and two 15-minute breaks. We have music to listen
        to, our minds to let wander, and our coworkers to talk to when we come across something interesting, like a
        thought, a bird</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s nest with featherless baby birds tucked
        in it, a question, a baby bunny to catch, pass around, hold, let go. We have only one responsibility for the day
        and it is to tuck in the vines. Every last one. </span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">The shoot-tuckers are loaded with pocketfuls of plastic clips that can be
        snapped onto the trellis wire to keep the shoot upright, but per the entropic tendencies of this universe, the
        vines have a way of slipping back out from under the wire, despite the clips</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4"> best efforts. </span></p>

        Must believe I am strengthening. Evelyn came today. Freaked out a bit, comparing myself to something I am not.
        She said, </span><span class="c1 c8">how old do you think I am?</span><span class="c1 c4"> She was on her knees,
        I was looking at her through my row of vines. Removing the bottom two leaves from every shoot. I said,
      </span><span class="c1 c8">about my age</span><span class="c1 c4">, even though I thought she was a little older
        because she said something about taking care of a family, so I thought she maybe had kids. She was wearing a
        black hoodie with the hood up over her blue baseball hat and a tan bandanna over her face and tight jeans tucked
        into leather boots. She said, </span><span class="c1 c8">how old are you?</span><span class="c1 c4"> and I said,
      </span><span class="c1 c8">27</span><span class="c1 c4">. Too old to be doing this, I suddenly feel. She said,
      </span><span class="c1 c8">me ganas por 7</span><span class="c1 c4">. She is only 20. Her dad died when she was
        17, and she came here to work. First she was in Salinas with her aunt. Now she</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s here with her brother. </span></p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>

    <p class="p9 c3" style="">June 13</p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">Later with Don Chava. Evelyn told him that I thought she was 27. I said,
      </span><span class="c1 c8">that</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">s because I didn</span><span
        class="c1 c8">’</span><span class="c1 c8">t act like how you act when I was 20</span><span class="c1 c4">. She
        said, and Don Chava agreed, </span><span class="c1 c8">well it</span><span class="c1 c8">’</span><span
        class="c1 c8">s different</span><span class="c1 c4">. Like it was something normal and understandable, that
        obviously I would not act how she did. I didn</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t feel that
        they passed any judgment on me. They didn</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t say anything
        about me having the luxury to linger in childhood because I was a privileged American. It just was.</span></p>

    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">The vines are such an everything that they become a nothing. Grapes are
        hardly worth mentioning. But they</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">re here, swelling in the
        heat of late June. Green, firm, the clusters assembling themselves. Pulling into formation. The leaves green,
        the grapes greener, the soil dry, the irrigation on, dripping, less sulfur now, less sneezing. </span></p>

        drop enough shoots and Gera walked me back down the row grabbing all the ones I should have pulled and collected
        them in one hand. Then, out of the carpet of dropped shoots covering the vineyard floor, he picked one up and
        matched it perfect as a puzzle piece to the spot where I had, as it turned out, mistakenly snipped it off.
      </span><span class="c1 c8">Uvas tiradas a la basura</span><span class="c1 c4"> (Grapes thrown in the garbage), he
        said without a hint of malice in his voice, but still I had tears welling up in my eyes. When we got to the end
        of the row, he had a bouquet of my mistakes in his hand, and he dropped them at the end post. They fell softly,
        my mistakes, green against the brown bristle of cut weeds. </span></p>

    <p class="p10 c4" style="">I am the biggest consumer of water in the crew. Although there are a few others that fill
      a flattened-down plastic water bottle, and stick it in their back pocket to quench their thirst mid-row (rows can
      be very long. Depending on the task and the length of the row, it might take over an hour, or an entire day, to
      complete just one, in which time a tremendous thirst can develop, especially if there is mucha platica going on),
      I am one of the very few to carry a water bottle on a shoelace slung over my shoulder. Although, often I am
      working so hard to keep up with everyone else, I can hardly afford to stop and drink, out of fear of falling even
      farther behind. </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">My coworkers often inform me that my face is very red. I respond to this
        by saying </span><span class="c1 c8">si, es por el calor</span><span class="c1 c4">, which (on the very hot
        days) translates in my exasperated anglophone head to</span><span class="c1 c4">—</span><span class="c1 c4">THIS
        IS WHAT HAPPENS TO WHITE PEOPLE FACES! WHEN THEY LABOR! IN THE HEAT! But then after thinking about it, I realize
        that they probably haven</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t seen many faces as white as
        mine laboring in the heat. Once a coworker reported to me that he could see a large blue vein going up my neck.

    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p10 c4" style="">I have seen my coworkers do things that I know my body could never handle: <br />Luis in
      94-degree heat, walking up and down the rows with his black sweatshirt dangling from his head by the hood, a
      cigarette dangling out of his mouth, a diesel-powered hedger held at shoulder height, his speaker looped to his
      beltloop, his phone in one pocket connected to his backup battery in the other, so that he can continue draining
      his phone battery to play music all day. </p>
    <p class="p1 p11" style=""> </p>
    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">I stopped and watched him for a while. He wasn</span><span
        class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">t crawling or barfing which is what I certainly would be doing. I
        walked away feeling empty, hollow. Like I had only ever lived in this thin sliver of life. That my roots had

        harvest. The canopies are thick and lush, dark green curtains partitioning each worker into private little
        tunnels. No more than 2 clusters per shoot, let the rest fall. Snip the wings off the clusters, make streamline
        the grapes. We have small, bottle-nosed scissors now and the focus too is small and bottle-nosed. The harvest

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">The difference between working in a vineyard all day with vines that are
        table top height versus vines that are regulation carry-on luggage height is very drastic. Either I come out
        feeling the same level of exhaustion as someone who</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s been
        on a long, hot hike speaking emphatic sign language, or I come out feeling like my knees are bleeding on the
        inside. I know it contributes to the quality of grapes if the vines are kept short, something about sap flow
        efficiency, but I wonder if the resulting difference in grape quality is proportionate to the resulting
        difference in knee health. I know people get used to it and develop techniques to not have to kneel so much, but
        at a certain point, it</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s really unavoidable. Some people
        drag along crates or buckets to sit down at each vine, but you can only get away with doing this if you are an
        extremely fast worker, because moving the crate slows you down. <br /><br />There</span><span

        the ground. Joel told me that the people who work there can only work there for 5 to 6 years, then they get
        sick. <br /></span><span class="c1 c8">What do you mean sick?</span><span class="c1 c4"> I asked him.

    <p class="p1" style=""><span class="c1 c4">In order to get to this rich and juicy terroir, the top 10-20 feet of
        land has to be excavated off. There is one place I work that is very remote. You drive off the main road, then
        up a side road, then out of society and into Vineland, where there are only dirt roads and fences and vineyards
        and no cell service. When you drive through Vineland you often pass by large mounds of pinkish grey rock. This
        is the rock that used to be the Earth</span><span class="c1 c4">’</span><span class="c1 c4">s uppermost crust,
        that has been dredged out in order to get to the farmable topsoil. Often times when we are working in Vineland,
